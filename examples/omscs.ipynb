The ubiquity of information and the associated need for the computation that accompanies it is driving this revolution only to be accelerated by the new paradigms such as the Internet-of-Things (IoT). These platforms are clearly very different in terms of their processing requirements which are very unique: real-time needs, high performance but at low energy, compact-code and data segments, and most importantly ever-changing software stack. Such unique requirements have led to a complete redesign and reinvention of both hardware and the software stack from the ground up. For example, brand new processors such as ARM, DSPs, and network processors were invented, in addition to new virtual machines such as Dalvik, new operating systems such as Android, and new programming models and compiler optimizations. The goal of this course is to take a holistic view of the embedded system stack with a focus on processor architectures, instruction sets, and the associated advanced compiler optimizations that take advantage of the same.

Because physical systems have \"a life of their own\", and they can often harm operators (think airplanes, medical devices, or cars) and/or cost a fortune to repair (think power grid and centrifuges), the development of programs that control these systems cannot rely much on \"trial and error\".

      "This course is a graduate-level introduction to scalable parallel algorithms. “Scale” really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes) grows. To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way you’ve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques you’ll need to do so. The techniques you’ll encounter cover the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and manycore shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others. The practical aspect of this course is implementing the algorithms and techniques you’ll learn to run on real parallel and distributed systems, so you can check whether what appears to work well in theory also translates into practice. (Programming models you’ll use include OpenMP, MPI, and possibly others.)\n",

To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way you’ve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques you’ll need to do so. The techniques you’ll encounter cover the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and manycore shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others. The practical aspect of this course is implementing the algorithms and techniques you’ll learn to run on real parallel and distributed systems, so you can check whether what appears to work well in theory also translates into practice. (Programming models you’ll use include OpenMP, MPI, and possibly others.)',\n",
