    "TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word or a group of words (a phrase) in a document or a set of documents. It is commonly used in information retrieval and natural language processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is calculated by multiplying the term frequency (TF) and the inverse document frequency (IDF). Let's take a closer look at each of these terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Term frequency (TF): The term frequency is a measure of how often a term appears in a document. It is calculated as the number of times a term appears in a document divided by the total number of terms in the document. For example, if the term \"cat\" appears 3 times in a document with a total of 100 terms, the term frequency for \"cat\" in that document is 0.03.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse document frequency (IDF): The inverse document frequency is a measure of how rare a term is across a set of documents. It is calculated as the logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents that contain the term. For example, if the term \"cat\" appears in 50 out of 1000 documents, the inverse document frequency for \"cat\" is log(1000/50) = 1.3.\n",
